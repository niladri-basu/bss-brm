# Bill Generation                       (pin_bill_accts)
#
#       We do the bill creation as two (parrallel) batches,
#       the active accounts and the closed/inactive accounts.
#
#       Run all types of accounts in one search since pin_bill_accts
#       is a multi-thread application. You also can specify a
#       particular type of account with one of [-active/close/inactive]
#       options.
#
#       This application can optionally take two parameters passed
#       via pin_bill_day script.
#
#       pin_bill_day -file PinBillRunControl.xml -split
#
#       These parameters are used to control bill runs.
#
#       The split parameter will specify audit revenue data to be collected
#
#       by  item type or not.
#
#       IMPORTANT: Must finish before next step.
