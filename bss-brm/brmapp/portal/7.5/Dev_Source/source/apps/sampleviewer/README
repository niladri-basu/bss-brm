Portal Sample Invoice Viewer CGI Application
===========================================

1. Introduction
---------------

Portal Sample Invoice Viewer is a sample CGI application that 
showcases the different invoice formats Portal supports and 
demonstrates XML-XSL technology for viewing and printing invoices.

2. Application Components
-------------------------

   2.1 pin_inv_view.pl

       The Perl5 program that does all the processing. The 
       program's functionality is as follows:

       * Displays the Invoiceviewer HTML form.

       * Displays bills that meet the user's search criteria.

       * Queries Portal for the invoice in the specified format 
         and show.

   2.2 pin_inv_view.conf

       The configuration file for the sample application. Specify 
       the following:

       * Names of the stylesheets you want to use with the 
         invoice viewer

       * Name of the GIF file with your company's logo

       * Location of the application, stylesheets, and GIF files

       For more information, see the comments in the file.

   2.3 pin.conf

       Specify your CM port and machine name in this file. This file is 
       similar to the pin.conf in the sys/test directory.

   2.4 invoice.short.name.xsl

       Sample XSL file, which transforms the invoice retrieved in XML 
       format to HTML.  The transformation is performed by the browser.

   2.5 image.gif

       Sample logo image.  This is the Portal logo.

3. Installation
---------------

   3.1 Copy pin_inv_view.pl to your web server's script directory. 

   3.2 Copy the configuration files, pin_inv_view.conf 
       and pin.conf, to the same location. 

   3.3 Copy the invoice.short.name.xsl file and the image.gif file 
       to a location under your web server's DocumentRoot. 

   3.4 Update the pin_inv_view.conf file with the script, 
       the stylesheet and the script locations. 

   3.5 Update pin.conf with your CM information (machine and 
       port).

   3.6 If your web server is NOT running on the SAME MACHINE as 
       Portal, do the following:

       3.6.1 Edit the pin_inv_view.pl file and update the Perl 
             binary location in the very first line. (if needed)

             For example:

             #!/usr/local/bin/perl

             Note that the application depends on 5.004_01 version 
             of Perl.  Also, it uses the following modules normally 
             included in the standard Perl distribution:

             lib.pm 
             Carp.pm 
             CGI.pm 
             TIME::Local.pm

       3.6.2 Copy the following files from the machine where 
             Portal is installed to the location where you  
             placed pin_inv_view.pl on the web server machine:

             $PINDIR/lib 
		(Unix)			(Windows)
             	pcmif.pm 		pcmif.pm
             	pcmif.so 		pcmif.dll
             	libpcm.so 		pcm.lib
             	libpcmext.so 		pcmext.lib
             	libpcp.so 		pcp.lib
             	libpinlog.so		pinlog.lib

4. Testing
----------

   4.1 After you complete steps 1 through 3, verify that all 
       Portal processes are up and running.

   4.2 Point your browser to the pin_inv_view.pl URL:

       http://<machine>:<port>/<scriptlocation>/pin_inv_view.pl

       You should see a "Portal Invoice Viewer" form. 
   4.3 Specify a valid account number, trial invoices or regular invoices, 
       and/or specify the bill date range, and click the "Search".

       If there are bills in the date range specified, they will appear 
       in the right frame with a choice of invoice formats.  If there are 
       no bills, or there is an error, you see a message in the 
       right frame.

5. Troubleshooting
------------------

   Turn on the $dump flag in pin_inv_view.pl script:

   $dump = 1

   This writes failure and information messages to Standard Error 
   and depending on where your web server stores stderr output, check 
   the appropriate locations.

   Some web servers write the stderr messages to the error_log 
   while others write it to a log[s]/stderr directory with the script 
   name.  Check with your webmaster.

6.  Customizing
---------------

   You can write your own XSL style sheets to view the XML invoices. 
   Edit the pin_inv_view.conf with your stylesheet information. The 
   style sheets appear in the stylesheet drop-down list.
