#************************************************************************
# Configuration File for Multithreading Application (MTA) Framework
#
# This configuration file controls how MTA (MultiThreraded Application)
# programs run. Several MTA applications, such as pin_inv_accts and
# pin_inv_export, can use this file. Some parameter names and values are
# generic; each of the generic entries begins with "- pin_mta", as in
# this example:
#
#   - pin_mta        fetch_size  30000
#
# Every other parameter name and value is specific to one application
# and begins with that application's name, as in this example:
#
#   - pin_inv_accts  fetch_size  40000
#
# Application-specific values always override generic values.
#
# You can edit this configuration file to suit your specific configuration:
#  -- You can change the default values of a parameter
#  -- You can exclude a parameter by adding the # symbol
#     at the beginning of the line
#  -- You can uncomment a parameter by removing the # symbol.
#
# Before you make any changes to this file, save a backup copy.
#
# When editing this file, follow the instructions in each section.
# For more information on the general syntax of configuration entries,
# see "Reference Guide to Portal Configuration Files" in the Portal
# online documentation.

# ptr_virtual_time
# 
# Enables the use of pin_virtual_time to advance Portal time, and 
# specifies the shared file for use by all Portal mangers.
#
# The entry has 2 values
#
# #/Empty     	to disable / enable pin_virtual_time in all pin.conf files
#		default = #	(disable)
#
# <filepath> 	location and name of the pin_virtual_time file shared by all Portal managers.

- - pin_virtual_time ${PIN_HOME}/lib/pin_virtual_time_file



#========================================================================
# cm_ptr
# 
# Specifies a pointer to the CM or CMMP. 
#
# Use a separate entry for each CM or CMMP. If testnap can't find the
# first CM or CMMP, it looks for the next in the list.
#
# Each entry includes three values:
# 
#     <protocol> = "ip", for this release
#     <host>     = the name or IP address of the computer running the
#                    CM or CMMP
#     <port>     = the TCP port number of the CM or CMMP on this computer
#
# The port number should match a corresponding cm_ports entry with
# the same port number in the CM or CMMP configuration file. The 
# default, 11960, is a commonly specified port for the CM or CMMP.
#========================================================================
- nap cm_ptr ip exlhamuatbrm 11960


#========================================================================
# login_type
#
# Specifies whether the login name and password are required.
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = Only a user ID is required.
#    1 = (Default) Both a name and a password are required.
#
# By default, CMs require a user login and password when requesting an open
# context using PCM_CONTEXT_OPEN. However, you can remove this authentication
# requirement by configuring the CM with a cm_login_module of
# cm_login_null.so
#========================================================================
- nap login_type 1


#========================================================================
# login_name
#
# Specifies the login name to use when testnap connects to the CM. 
#========================================================================
- nap login_name root.0.0.0.1


#========================================================================
# login_pw
#
# Specifies the password to use when testnap connects to the CM.
#========================================================================
- nap login_pw   password


#========================================================================
# userid
#
# Specifies the database number and service type for the Portal
# database. 
#
# The CM uses the database number to identify the Portal database 
# and to connect to the correct Data Manager. For connections that don't
# require a login name and password, the CM also passes the service
# type to the database.
#
# The database number, in the form 0.0.0.N, is the number assigned to 
# your Portal database when you installed the system. The default
# is 0.0.0.1.
#
# The service type is /service/pcm_client and the ID is 1.
# DO NOT change these values.
#========================================================================
- - userid 0.0.0.1 /service/pcm_client 1


#========================================================================
# hotlist
#
# Specifies the location (path and file name) of the hot-list file.
#
# A hot list is a file containing an array of POIDs that need to be
# handled by the MTA application's working threads first. This priority
# lets some threads begin working on some known large or complex accounts
# and bills as early as possible. The array of POIDs might be hard-coded
# in the file that lists hosts, or the file could be generated by some
# other application.
#
# The array of POIDs must be in flist format. Refer to the example
# files in the distribution for more information about the hot-list file.
#========================================================================
- pin_mta hotlist hotlist


#========================================================================
# mta_logfile
#
# Specifies the full path to the log file used by this MTA application.
#
# You can enter any valid path.
#========================================================================
- pin_mta logfile ${PIN_LOG_DIR}/td_payment_processing/td_payment_processing.pinlog


#========================================================================
# loglevel
#
# Specifies how much information the applications log.
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = no logging
#    1 = (Default) log error messages only
#    2 = log error messages and warnings
#    3 = log error, warning, and debugging messages
#========================================================================
- pin_mta loglevel 3


#========================================================================
# max_errs
# 
# Specifies the maximum number of errors that the application can ignore.
#
# This entry is optional. By default, max_errs = fetch_size.
#========================================================================
- pin_mta max_errs 5000


#========================================================================
# monitor
#
# Specifies the location of shared memory (the memory-map file).
#
# Use this entry to set the path and name of a shared memory-map file.
# This binary file stores information about the running MTA application.
# With help from another application such as pin_mta_monitor, you can
# view and adjust the number of threads that are running in the MTA
# application without interrupting it.
#========================================================================
- pin_mta monitor monitor


#========================================================================
# multi_db
#
# Enables or disables the multidatabase capability of MTA.
#
# If you enable multi_db, MTA uses global searching instead of the
# normal searching. The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = (Default) Disable global searching
#    1 = Enable global searching
#========================================================================
- pin_mta multi_db 0


#========================================================================
# Performance Parameters
# 
# The entries below govern how the MTA applications pull data from the
# database and tranfer the data to the application space. They also
# define how many threads (children) are used to process the data in
# the application.
#
#    children   = number of threads used to process the accounts in the
#                 application
#    per_batch  = number of accounts processed by each child
#    per_step   = number of accounts returned in each database search
#    fetch_size = number of accounts cached in application memory
#                 before processing starts
#
# Some applications do not use all of these performance parameters. For
# example, pin_inv_accts does not use per_batch.
#
# You can edit these entries to improve performance of MTA applications.
# Different MTA applications process accounts differently, so you
# usually need to configure these entries differently for each
# application. To specify an entry for a single MTA application, replace 
# the generic name "pin_mta" with the name of the specific application.
# For example, you might have these entries:
#
#    - pin_mta          fetch_size  30000
#    - pin_inv_accts    fetch_size  50000
#
# For a complete explanation of setting these variables for best
# performance, see the online document "Portal Configuration and
# Tuning Guide."

# 
# Respawns worker threads if they exit due to an error. Threads are
