# cache_references_at_start
#
# Specifies whether to store objects referenced by price objects
# in memory in the CM cache when the CM starts. Objects referenced
# by price objects include BEIDs, GLIDs, tax suppliers, 
# event types, service types, and RUMs. 
#
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = The CM caches objects that are referenced by price objects 
#        in the CM cache every time a price list is committed. 
#         
#        In a production system where you rarely modify your price
#        list, set the flag to 0. This reserves the CM cache
#        for other uses and eliminates the need to restart the
#        CM to update the cache if you change the price list. 
#         
#    1 = (Default) The CM caches objects that are referenced by price 
#         objects one time when the CM starts. 
#
#        In a test environment where you modify your price list
#        often, set the flag to 1. This makes saving the  
#        price list faster since there is no need to load price 
#        reference objects every time you commit the price list
#        to the database. However, you must restart the CM after
#        your price list changes are committed. 
#
# Important: The objects that are referenced by price objects are 
#            created every time the CM starts. If these objects are 
#            changed in the database, the CM must be restarted to 
#            create the new information to place into the cache.
