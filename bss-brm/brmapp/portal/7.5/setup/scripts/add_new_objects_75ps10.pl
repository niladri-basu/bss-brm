#    NAME
#      add_new_objects_75ps10.pl - This module will result in creating new objects or modifying existing ones
#
#    DESCRIPTION
#      This File will contain subroutines to create objects or modify existing object behaviour
#      This file will be called from pin_75ps10_upgrade.pl first in the order.

#      For each feature, there will be having their own set of create or modify scripts
#      [These scripts will be having .source extension].
#      There will be one .source per addition of new table object or
#      one .source per addition of set of columns to an existing table object.
#      These scripts will be called one by one by this Perl File
#      add_new_objects_75ps10.pl for execution and updating the DB Schema
#      with new objects or modifying existing objects [tables or columns].
#
#    NOTES
#      This Script will be used to execute all the scripts which are creating
#      new objects/modifying existing objects in the Database and also updating
#      the Data Dictionary with this information.

#      The Driver File for upgrade which is the script "pin_75ps10_upgrade.pl"
#      will call this perl script (add_new_objects_75ps10.pl) through one of its wrappers APIs
#      named "create_new_objects()" and "modify_existing_objects()".

#      The execution methodology will be the same as the execution of the other object creation script.

#      How this script will work

#      This Perl file will invoke the API "pin_init()" which in turn calls the function
#      "parse_execute_opcode_file" which takes as input the opcode file [each feature specific
#      create/modify object scripts in this case] and executes the opcode file there by creating
#      the new objects or modifying the existing object in the database as well as updating the
#      data dictionary and returns the execution results for each script executed.
#      Using this result value a suitable message will be printed on the prompt whether the script
#      execution was a success or failure and the place where it failed, in case the execution failed.

#       Error Handling
#
#       The Error Handling will be done by logging the error messages in the log file.
#       This log file is pin_setup.log which will be generated in $PIN_HOME/setup directory.
#       So whenever there will be an error as part of execution of this script, there will
#       a value returned at the end of this script. Based on that return value, it will
#       be easier to track, the point of failure [in terms of name of feature scripts],
#       when this script is called by the wrapper APIs [create_new_objects() and  modify_existing_objects() ] from
#       the driver file "pin_75ps10_upgrade.pl". So in case a failed result value is returned,
#       the further execution process of upgrade will be stopped.
#       This stopping of the further execution will be handled in the driver file.
